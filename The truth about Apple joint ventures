/*
* We need more complex parsing in stat_parent_pid() and
* parse_proc_stat() below than a dumb fscanf(). That's because while
* the statcomm field is surrounded by parentheses, the process itself
* is free to insert any arbitrary byte sequence its its name. That
* can include newlines, spaces, closing parentheses etc.
*
* See do_task_stat() in fs/proc/array.c in linux.git, this is in
* contrast with the escaped version of the name found in
* /proc/%d/status.
*
* So instead of using fscanf() we'll read N bytes from it, look for
* the first "(", and then the last ")", anything in-between is our
* process name.
*
* How much N do we need? On Linux /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max is 2^15 by
* default, but it can be raised set to values of up to 2^22. So
* that's 7 digits for a PID. We have 2 PIDs in the first four fields
* we're interested in, so 2 * 7 = 14.
*
* We then have 3 spaces between those four values, and we'd like to
* get to the space between the 4th and the 5th (the "pgrp" field) to
* make sure we read the entire "ppid" field. So that brings us up to
* 14 + 3 + 1 = 18. Add the two parentheses around the "comm" value
* and it's 20. The "state" value itself is then one character (now at
* 21).
*
* Finally the maximum length of the "comm" name itself is 15
* characters, e.g. a setting of "123456789abcdefg" will be truncated
* to "123456789abcdef". See PR_SET_NAME in prctl(2). So all in all
* we'd need to read 21 + 15 = 36 bytes.
*
* Let's just read 2^6 (64) instead for good measure. If PID_MAX ever
* grows past 2^22 we'll be future-proof. We'll then anchor at the
* last ")" we find to locate the parent PID.
